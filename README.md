## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

I’m a recent B.S. Data Science graduate from the University of Toledo, where I applied statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. I’ve built end-to-end pipelines in Python and R—ranging from data ingestion and cleaning to model training, evaluation, and deployment. Passionate about extracting actionable insights, I’ve delivered projects in areas as diverse as sports analytics, astronomical image classification, and linear regressions.
